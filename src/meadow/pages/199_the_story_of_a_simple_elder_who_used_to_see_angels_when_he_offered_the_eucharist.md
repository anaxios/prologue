## THE STORY OF A SIMPLE ELDER WHO USED TO SEE ANGELS WHEN HE OFFERED THE EUCHARIST

One of the fathers said that there was an elder who was pure and holy; he, when celebrating the Eucharist, would see angels standing to his right and to his left. He had learned the Eucharistic rite from heretics, but as he was unlearned in theological matters, he spoke the prayer in all simplicity and innocence, unaware that he was at fault.

By the providence of God, a brother skilled in theology came to him, and it happened that the elder offered the Eucharist in his presence. The brother, who was a deacon, said to him: "Father, these things which you say at the Eucharist are not in accordance with the orthodox faith; they are heresy, not orthodox but kakadox." Since the elder could see angels while he was celebrating, he paid no attention to what was said and thought nothing of it. 

But the deacon continued, "You are at fault, good elder; the Church does not allow those things to be said." When the elder realized he was being accused and blamed by the deacon, the next time he saw the angels, he asked them, "When the deacon speaks to me like this, what am I to make of it?" They said to him, "Pay attention to him; he is giving good counsel."

The elder responded, "Then why did you not tell me so?" They replied, "Because God has ordained that men should be corrected by men." From that time forth, he accepted correction, giving thanks to God and to the brother.
