## CONCERNING THE SAME

They say that the same elder was once sitting in his cell when the devil appeared to him in visible form and said, "Get away from here, elder, for it is no good for you." The elder replied to the demon, "To convince me that you want me to go away, make what I am sitting on start walking around." He was seated on a wicker-work chair. 

When the demon heard this, he immediately caused not only the seat but also the whole cell to move around. Upon perceiving the craftiness of the demon, the elder said, "Now, since you are so fierce and terrible, I will most certainly not go away." He then offered a prayer, and the hostile demon disappeared.
