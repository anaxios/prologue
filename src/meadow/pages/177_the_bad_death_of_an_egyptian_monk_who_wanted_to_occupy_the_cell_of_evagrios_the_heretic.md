## THE BAD DEATH OF AN EGYPTIAN MONK WHO WANTED TO OCCUPY THE CELL OF EVAGRIOS, THE HERETIC

Abba John the Cilician told us that while they were staying at the ninth mile-post from Alexandria, an Egyptian monk visited them and said: “A brother from foreign parts came to the Lavra of The Cells and wanted to stay there. He prostrated himself before the priest presbyteros and requested that he might stay the night at the cell of Evagrios. The priest told him that he could not stay there. 

The brother replied, “If I may not stay there, I will go away.” The priest said to him, “My child, the fact of the matter is that a cruel demon inhabits that place. It led Evagrios astray, alienating him from the true faith, and it filled his mind with abominable teachings.” The brother persisted, saying, “If I am to remain here, that is where I am going to stay.” 

Then the priest warned him, “On your own head be it: go and stay there.” The brother went and stayed there for a week, and when the holy day of the Lord came around, he came to the church. The priest was relieved to see him. However, the following Sunday he did not come to church, so the priest summoned two brothers to go and find out why he was not present. They went to the cell and found that the brother had put a rope around his neck and strangled himself.
