## A Well That Filled with Water When an Icon of the Same Abba Theodosios Was Let Down into It

The same fathers also told us that in those days, a Christ-loving woman from the district of Apamea dug a well. She spent a great deal of money on the project and dug very deep, but she found no water. Having invested so much money and effort into the project, she was very discouraged. 

Then one day, she had a vision of someone saying to her: "Send for and bring the picture of Abba Theodosios at Skopelos, and through that means, God will give you water." The woman sent two men at once. They took the icon of the saint and lowered it into the well. Immediately, water began to flow, filling the well shaft up to the halfway point. 

The men who drew the icon up out of the water brought us some of it; we drank from it and all gave thanks to God.
