## THE RESPONSE OF ABBA THEODORE OF PENTAPOLIS TO THE QUESTION OF ABSTAINING FROM WINE

Twenty miles from Alexandria, there is a lavra called Calam√©n, situated between the eighteenth mile-post and Maphora. There, we met Abba Theodore (Sophronios the Sophist was with us) and asked him if it was permissible to break the rule of abstaining from wine when visiting someone, or when someone paid us a visit. He replied that it was not permissible. 

We then inquired why the fathers of old times would sometimes set aside that rule. The elder responded, "The fathers of old time were truly great and highly disciplined men who could loosen the rule and then bind it again. This present generation is not strong enough to loosen the rule and then to bind it again. If we once loosen the rule, we no longer maintain our ascetic way of life."
