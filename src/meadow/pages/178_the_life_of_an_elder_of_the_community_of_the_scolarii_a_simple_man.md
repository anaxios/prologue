## THE LIFE OF AN ELDER OF THE COMMUNITY OF THE SCOLARII, A SIMPLE MAN

Abba Gregory, priest of the Community of the Scholarii, told us that at Monidia there lived a monk who was an exceedingly hard worker, but somewhat indiscriminate in matters of faith. He would receive Holy Communion in whatever church he happened to be in. 

One day, an angel of God appeared to him and said, “Tell me, elder, when you die, how do you want us to bury you? The way the Egyptian monks bury the dead, or after the custom of Jerusalem?” The elder replied that he did not know, and the angel responded, “Think about it. I will come to you three weeks from now and you shall tell me.” 

The elder went to a colleague and shared what he had heard from the angel. The second elder was utterly amazed at this revelation. He stared at the man for a long time; then, inspired by God, he asked, “Where do you partake of the holy mysteries?” The other replied, “Wherever I happen to be.” 

The elder admonished him, “Never again should you communicate outside the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, in which the four holy councils are named: the council of the three hundred and eighteen fathers at Nicaea, that of the one hundred and fifty fathers at Constantinople, the first Council of Ephesos of two hundred, and that of the six hundred and thirty fathers at Chalcedon. And when the angel comes, say to him, ‘I wish to be buried according to the custom of Jerusalem.’” 

Three weeks later, the angel came and asked, “Which is it to be, elder? Have you given thought to the matter?” The elder replied that he wished to be buried according to the Jerusalem custom. The angel responded, “Very well, very well,” and the elder immediately surrendered his soul. This was done so that the elder would not lose his labor and be condemned as a heretic.
