## A Miracle of the Lord for the Wife and Daughter of One of the Faithful Who Was Accustomed to Entertaining Monks

On another occasion when we were visiting him, Abba Palladios told us about a Christ-loving man living in Alexandria, a man of great piety and mercy, who was hospitably disposed towards monks. He was married to a woman of singular piety who fasted all day long, and they had a six-year-old daughter. One day, this Christian gentleman set out for Constantinople, for he was a merchant. He left his wife and child with one servant in the house and departed to find a ship.

As he was leaving to embark, his wife said to him, “To whom are you commending us?” The husband replied, “To our Lady, the Mother of God.” 

One day, while the mother was occupied with her tasks and the child was with her, the devil put it into the mind of the servant to murder the woman and her child, seize all their possessions, and run away. He took a knife from the kitchen and went to the dining room where the mistress was. However, when he reached the dining room door, he was afflicted with blindness, so that he was unable either to return to the kitchen or to go into the dining room. 

He spent over an hour flailing in the air and making every effort to enter. Then he began to call for his mistress, saying, “Come here.” She was surprised that the servant was standing in the doorway and did not come to her, but rather called for her to approach him. She replied, “You come here,” for she did not know that he had been struck blind. 

The servant then began to entreat her with oaths to approach him, but she swore that she would not. He said to her, “Then send the child to me,” but she refused, saying, “If you want to, you come here.” 

Realizing that he was incapable of helping himself, the servant turned the knife around and struck himself a mortal blow. When his mistress saw what he had done, she screamed out, and the neighbors came in immediately. The police arrived as well and found the servant still alive. They learned everything from him and glorified the God who showed wonders, saving both the mother and her child.
