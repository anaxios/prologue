## THE LIFE OF ABBA ISAAC OF THEBES AND HOW A DEMON APPEARED TO HIM IN THE FORM OF A YOUTH

There is a city in the Thebaid called Lycos. Six miles from it, there is a mountain where monks live: some in caves and others in cells. When we went there, we met Abba Isaac the Theban, who said:

"For fifty-two years, I was working at my handwork (I was making a large mosquito net) and I made a mistake. I was very upset about that mistake because I could not find it. I spent the whole day in distress and did not know what to do. While I was so distraught, a youth came in through the window and said to me, ‘You have made a mistake. Give the work to me and I will put it right.’

I replied, ‘Get out of here, you! May it never be that I should do such a thing!’ He answered me, ‘But it will be pain and grief to you if you have done it badly.’ I said to him, ‘There is no need for you to worry yourself about that.’ 

‘But I am sorry for you,’ he rejoined, ‘because of your wasted effort,’ and I said, ‘Neither you nor those who brought you are welcome here.’ But he replied, ‘Actually, it was you who compelled me to come here, and you are mine.’ 

I asked him how he could say that. ‘Because three Sundays running you have received holy communion whilst being at daggers drawn with your neighbor,’ he said—and I told him he was lying. He continued, ‘Are you not harboring a grudge against him because of a plate of lentils? I am the one who is in charge of grudges and, from now on, you are mine.’

When I heard that, I left my cell, went to the brother in question, and prostrated myself before him in order to become reconciled with him. When I returned, I found that my visitor had burned the mosquito net and the mat on which I had prostrated myself, because he was so consumed with jealousy for our love."
