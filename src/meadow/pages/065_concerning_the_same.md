## CONCERNING THE SAME

Abba John, surnamed Molybas, told about this elder (I mean Abba Stephan) that when he was lying seriously ill, the doctors urged him to eat some meat. This blessed brother had a blood brother in secular society, a very devout man who lived his life for the living God. 

As the brother was eating the meat, his natural brother, who lived "in the world," came to visit him—and was offended when he saw what was happening. He was distressed (he said) that after so long a period of ascetic rigor and self-discipline, his brother should now partake of meat. 

He immediately went into a trance and saw one who spoke to him, saying: “Why are you offended at the sight of the priest eating meat? Do you not realize that he ate it out of necessity and obedience? In truth, you ought not to be offended. If you want to know to what glory your brother has attained, then turn round and look.” 

He said that he turned round and saw the priest, crucified—just as Christ was crucified; and the apparition said: “You see to what glory he has attained? Glorify Him who glorifies those who truly love Him.”
