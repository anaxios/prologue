## Three Dead Monks Found by Fishermen at Paran

Some fishermen from Paran shared their story with us: Once, we ventured to Bouchti, on the other side of the Red Sea. We had a good catch and began our journey back. We anchored off Pteleos, intending to sail on to Raithou, but we were detained by contrary winds. A heavy sea held us up for ninety days.

While exploring that vast wilderness, we discovered three anchorites dead beneath one stone. They were wearing habits made of palm fiber, and their cloaks lay beside them. We brought the three corpses to the ship, and immediately the stormy sea subsided. The winds shifted into a favorable direction. We sailed with a following wind and arrived at Raithou, where the fathers buried them, along with the elders of former times.
