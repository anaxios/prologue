## ABBA JORDANES’ STORY OF THE SARACENS WHO KILLED EACH OTHER

Abba Jordanes also told us that Abba Nicholas said to him: In the reign of the most faithful Emperor Maurice, when the Saracen leader Naaman was making his raids, I was traveling around Annon and Aidon when I saw three Saracens. They had as their prisoner a very handsome young man, about twenty years old. When he saw me, he began crying out to me to take him away from them. 

So, I started begging the Saracens to let him go. One of the Saracens answered me in Greek, “We are not letting him go.” I replied, “Take me and let him go, for he cannot endure servitude.” The same Saracen responded, “We are not letting him go.” 

Then I asked them for the third time, “Will you let him go for a ransom? Hand him over to me, and I will go seek and bring whatever you demand.” The Saracen replied, “We cannot give him to you because we promised our priest that if we took a good-looking prisoner, we would bring him to the priest to be offered as a sacrifice. Now be off with you, or we will cause your head to roll on the ground.” 

I then prostrated myself before God and said, “O Lord God, our Saviour, save your servant.” Immediately, the three Saracens became possessed by demons. They drew their swords and cut each other to pieces. I took the young man to my cave, and he no longer wished to leave me. He renounced the world, and after completing seven years in the monastic life, he went to his rest. He was from Tyre.
