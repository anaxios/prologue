## ANOTHER MIRACLE OF THE HOLY MOTHER OF GOD BY WHICH COSMIANA, WIFE OF GERMANOS, WAS COMPELLED TO RETURN TO THE TRUE FAITH FROM THE SEVERAN HERESY

Anastasios, priest and treasurer at the holy Church of the Resurrection of Christ our God, told us that Cosmiana, the wife of Germanos the Patrician, came one night wishing to worship alone at the holy and life-giving sepulchre of our Lord Jesus Christ, the true God. 

When she approached the sanctuary, our Lady, the holy Mother of God, together with other women, met her in visible form and said to her, “As you are not one of us, you are not to come in here, for you are none of ours.” The woman was, in fact, a member of the sect of Severus Acephalos. She begged earnestly for permission to enter, but the holy Mother of God replied, “Believe me, woman, you shall not come in here until you are in communion with us.”

The woman realized that it was because she was a heretic that she was being refused entry, and that she would not be allowed in until she joined the holy Catholic and apostolic Church of Christ our God. She sent for the deacon, and when the holy chalice arrived, she partook of the holy body and blood of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ. Thus, she was found worthy to worship unimpeded at the holy and life-giving sepulchre of our Lord Jesus Christ.
