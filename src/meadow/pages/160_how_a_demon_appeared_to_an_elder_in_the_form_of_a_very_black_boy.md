## How A DEMON APPEARED TO AN ELDER IN THE FORM OF A VERY BLACK BOY

Abba Paul, higoumen of the monastery of Abba Theognias, told us that a certain ascetic elder had said: 

“One day I was sitting in my cell doing my handwork (I was plaiting baskets, actually, and singing psalms) when, suddenly, what looked like a Saracen youth wearing a bread-basket came in through the window. He stood before me and began to dance. As I continued singing psalms, he asked me, ‘Elder, do I dance well?’ I answered not a word. 

He spoke again, ‘Do you like the way I dance, elder?’ As I continued to remain silent, he remarked, ‘Oh, wicked old man; why do you imagine you are doing something important? I tell you, you made a mistake in the sixty-fifth, the sixty-sixth, and the sixty-seventh psalms.’ 

Then I stood up and prostrated myself before God, and he disappeared at once.”
