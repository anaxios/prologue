## The Life of a Woman Who Remained Faithful to Her Husband, a Merchant, and How God Helped Them Both

We came to the hospice of the Fathers at Ascalon, and there Eusebios the priest said to us: There was a merchant of our city who set sail and lost all his goods and everything else he was carrying at sea. He alone was saved. When he returned, he was seized by his creditors and thrown into prison. Everything in his house was confiscated. There was nothing left to him except what he and his wife stood up in.

Although she was in great distress and anxiety, she made it a rule to at least feed her husband with bread. One day, while she was sitting and eating with her husband in prison, a person of note came in to distribute some comforts to the inmates. When he saw the woman, who was free to come and go, sitting with her husband, he was smitten with desire for her, for she was exceedingly good-looking. He sent a message to her through the gaoler, and she came to him with a light heart, expecting to receive some charity.

He took her aside and said to her, "What is the matter? Why are you here?" She told him the whole story, and he replied, "If I discharge your debt, will you sleep with me tonight?" She, being very beautiful and pure-minded, said to him, "My lord, I have heard the Apostle Paul say that a wife does not have authority over her own body; her husband has. Let me go and ask my husband, sir, and I shall do what he commands."

She returned and told her husband the whole matter. He was a wise man who loved his wife dearly; he did not let the prospect of freedom lead him astray. Sighing deeply and shedding tears, he said to her, "Go and refuse the man, sister, and let us hope in God that He will not abandon us at the last." She got up and sent the man away, saying, "I told my husband, and he was unwilling."

At that time, there was a highwayman who had been thrown into the inner prison. Observing all that passed between the husband and his wife, he sighed to himself and said, "Look at their situation—yet they would not surrender their honor either for money or for freedom. They hold chastity to be of more worth than all riches and despise the things of this life. And what shall I do, wretch that I am, who have never even thought about the question of whether there is a God—and on that account, I am responsible for so many murders?"

He called them over, and through the window of the cell where he lay, he said to them, "I was a robber, and many are the evil deeds and murders I have committed. For that reason, when the governor comes and I appear before him, I shall die as a murderer. Yet when I saw your chastity, I was moved with compassion for you. Go to such-and-such a place by the city wall; dig there, and take the money you find. You are to have it to discharge your debts and to make many charitable donations. Pray for me, that I might receive mercy."

A few days later, the governor came to the city and ordered the robber to be brought out and beheaded. The day afterward, the woman said to her husband, "Is it your wish, sir, that I go to the place revealed by the robber and see if he was telling the truth?" He said to her, "Do what you think best." 

She got a small mattock and, in the evening, went to dig at the spot he had mentioned. She found a covered pot filled with gold. She used it very prudently, giving it out a little at a time (as though she were borrowing from this one and that one) until she had discharged all their debts. Then she was also able to get her husband out. The man who told us this story said, "Behold, even as they were faithful to the law of God, so did our Lord and God multiply His mercies on them."
