## SAYINGS OF ABBA ALEXANDER THE ELDER

Abba Alexander, the elder of Abba Vincent, said to the brethren: "Our fathers sought out the wilderness and affliction; we seek for cities and comfort." Again, he remarked: "In the days of our fathers, the virtues of poverty and humility flourished; these days, avarice and pride are in fashion." Furthermore, he observed: "Our fathers never used to wash their faces; but we indulge ourselves at the public baths." He lamented: "Alas, children, we have eliminated the angelic way of life."

Abba Vincent, his disciple, responded: "We are indeed sickly, father." The elder rejoined: "What do you mean, Vincent, by 'We are sickly?' Believe me, child: we are fit in body as Olympic athletes, but we are sick indeed in the soul." He added: "We are able to eat and drink a great deal and to wear fine clothing; but we are incapable of mastering our passions or our pride." Lastly, the elder said: "Oh, Alexander, Alexander! How you are going to be put to shame when others receive the crown!"
