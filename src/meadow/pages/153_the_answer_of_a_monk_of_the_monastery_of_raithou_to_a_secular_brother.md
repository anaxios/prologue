## THE ANSWER OF A MONK OF THE MONASTERY OF RAITHOU TO A SECULAR BROTHER

There were two brothers living in the world, at Constantinople, who were very devout and much given to fasting. One of them came to Raithou, where he renounced the world and became a monk. Some time later, his brother, who still lived in the world, came to Raithou to see his brother, now become a monk. 

While he was staying there, the worldly brother saw the monastic brother taking refreshment at the ninth hour. He was offended and said to his brother: "Brother, when you were in the world, you never took refreshment before sunset." 

Then the monk said to him: "In truth, brother, when I was in the world, I received sustenance through my ears; for vain glory and the praise of men sustained me in no small way and eased the discomfort of the austerity."
