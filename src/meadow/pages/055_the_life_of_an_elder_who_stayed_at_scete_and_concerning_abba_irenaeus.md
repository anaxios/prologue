## The Life of an Elder Who Stayed at Sceté and Concerning Abba Irenaeus

Abba Irenaeus told us that there was an elder living at Scété who saw the devil at night offering gardening implements to the brethren. The elder said to the devil, “What are these?” The devil replied, “I am presenting the brothers with a distraction to make them less assiduous in glorifying God.”

The same Abba Irenaeus spoke to us again, saying: When barbarians came to Scété, I withdrew and came into the district of Gaza, where I accepted a cell for myself at the Lavra. From the abba of the Lavra, I received a book of sayings of the elders. That same day, I set myself to read it, and as soon as I unrolled the book, I found a passage in which a brother visited an elder and said to him, “Pray for me, father.” The elder replied, “When you were with us, I used to pray for you. Now that you have gone away to your own homeland, I pray for you no longer.”

When I read this, I rewound the book and said to myself, “Oh wretched Irenaeus, to have fled to your own homeland—and the fathers no longer pray for you!” I immediately gave the book back to the abba, left that place, and came to The Cells. And that, children, is why I am here.
