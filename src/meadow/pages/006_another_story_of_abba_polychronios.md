## ANOTHER STORY OF ABBA POLYCHRONIOS

Abba Polychronios the priest told us that he had heard from Abba Constantine, who was the higoumen of the New Lavra of Holy Mary, the Mother of God, that one of the brethren died in the hospital at Jericho. They brought him back to The Towers to bury him there, and from the moment they left the hospital until they arrived at The Towers, a star traveled with them and never ceased shining over the dead brother until they laid him in the earth.
