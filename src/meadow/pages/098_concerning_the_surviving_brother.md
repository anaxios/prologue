## CONCERNING THE SURVIVING BROTHER

Whilst this brother was staying by the holy Jordan after his brother’s death, an elder came from the Lavra of Calamén and said to him: “Tell me, brother: what good has it done you persevering so long in silent recollection and self-denial?” The brother replied, “Go away and come back in ten days’ time, and I will tell you.” 

The elder returned after ten days and found the brother dead. He discovered a piece of broken pottery with the following written on it: “Forgive me, father, but I have never let my mind remain earth-bound whilst performing my spiritual duties.”
