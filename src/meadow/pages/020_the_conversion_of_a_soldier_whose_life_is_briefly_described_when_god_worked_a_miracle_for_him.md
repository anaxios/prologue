## The Conversion of a Soldier (Whose Life is Briefly Described) When God Worked a Miracle for Him

One of the fathers told me that a military standard-bearer had shared the following account: 

"We were in a battle with the Mauritanians in the African provinces. The barbarians defeated us and put us to flight. They pursued us, and many of us were slain. One of the barbarians caught up with me and raised his spear to strike me. When I saw this, I began calling on God. 

'Lord God,' I said, 'You who appeared to your servant Thecla and delivered her from impious hands: deliver me from this calamity and save me from this bitter death. Then I will go and lead a life of solitude in the desert.'

When I turned around, there was not a barbarian in sight. I came straight away to this Lavra of Kopratha, and by the grace of God, I have lived thirty years in this cave."
