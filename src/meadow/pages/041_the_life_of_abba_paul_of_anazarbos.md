## THE LIFE OF ABBA PAUL OF ANAZARBOS

At the same Lavra of Pharén, we saw Abba Paul, a holy man of great humility and self-abnegation, wholly devoted to God; a man who wept many tears each day. I don’t know whether I ever met his like in all my life. For almost fifty years, this elder had led a solitary life, sustained by nothing more than the charitable dole of the church, for he would accept nothing in addition to the rations he received. He came from Anazarbos.
