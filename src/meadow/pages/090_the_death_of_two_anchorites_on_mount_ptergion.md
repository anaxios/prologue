## The Death of Two Anchorites on Mount Ptergion

There were two anchorites beyond Rossos, living on Mount Ptergion, near the River Piapi and the monastery of Abba Theodosios at Skopelos. The elder anchorite died, and his disciple offered a prayer and buried him on the mountain. A few days later, the disciple of the anchorite came down from the mountain and approached the inhabited world, oikoumené. He came across a man working his land and said to him, “Of your charity, good fellow, take your mattock and spade and come with me.” The peasant did what the anchorite requested at once. 

When they reached the mountain, the anchorite showed the man who lived in the world the tomb of his elder, the grave of the anchorite, and said to him, “Dig here.” While the peasant was digging, the anchorite stood in prayer. When his prayer was finished, he embraced the man from the world, saying, "Brother, pray for me, sir." He went down into the grave, placed himself on top of the elder, and surrendered his soul. The man from the world filled the grave in and gave thanks to God. 

After he had gone about a stone’s throw down the mountainside, he said to himself, “I really ought to have received a blessing from those holy men.” He returned, but he could not find the saints’ grave.
