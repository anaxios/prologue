## THE DEED OF A BALD MAN DRESSED IN SACK-CLOTH

When my companion and I were in Alexandria, one day we went to the Church of Saint Theodosios. A bald man approached us, dressed in sackcloth that reached down to his knees. He appeared to be insane. Abba Sophronios said to me, "Give me a coin, and you shall see the virtue of this man who is approaching us." I gave him five coppers, which he took and handed to the man who seemed to be insane. The man received them without uttering a word. 

Keeping ourselves out of sight, we followed him. When he turned the corner of the street, he stretched out his right hand, in which he held the coins, toward heaven, raised it high, and then prostrated himself before God. After that, he went his way, leaving the coins on the ground.
