## THE DEED OF A RELIGIOUS SHIP-MASTER WHO PRAYED TO THE LORD FOR RAIN

Abba Gregory the anchorite told us: I was returning from Byzantium by ship when a scribe came aboard with his wife; he had to go pray at the Holy City. The ship-master was a very devout man, given to fasting. As we sailed along, the scribe’s attendants were prodigal in their use of water. When we came into the midst of the high sea, we ran out of water and found ourselves in great distress. It was a pitiful sight—women, children, and infants perishing from thirst, lying there like corpses. We endured this distressing condition for three days and abandoned hope of survival. 

Unable to tolerate such affliction, the scribe drew his sword, intending to kill the ship-master and the sailors. He said, “It is their fault that we are to be lost, for they did not take sufficient water on board for our needs.” I interceded with the scribe, saying, “Do not do that; but rather, let us pray to our Lord Jesus Christ, our true God, who does great and wonderful things which cannot be counted (Job 34:26). Behold, this is now the third day that the ship-master has occupied himself with fasting and prayer.” 

The scribe quieted down, and on the fourth day, about the sixth hour, the ship-master got up and cried in a loud voice, “Glory to thee, Christ our God!”—and he did so in such a way that we were all astonished at his cry. He then said to the sailors, “Stretch out the skins,” and while they were unfolding them, look! A cloud came over the ship, and it rained enough water to satisfy all our needs. 

It was a great and fearful wonder, for as the ship was borne along by the wind, the cloud followed us; however, it did not rain beyond the ship.
