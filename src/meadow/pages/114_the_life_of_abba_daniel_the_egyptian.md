## THE LIFE OF ABBA DANIEL, THE EGYPTIAN

On another occasion, the same elder told us this about Abba Daniel the Egyptian: One day, this elder went up to Terenuthis to sell what he had made with his hands. A young man entreated the elder, saying, “For the love of God, come into my house, good elder, and offer a prayer over my wife, for she is sterile.” 

The elder let himself be persuaded by the young man and went into his house with him. He offered a prayer over the woman, and as it was the will of God, she became pregnant. Some men who did not fear God began to defame the elder, saying, “The truth of the matter is that the young man is sterile. It is by Abba Daniel that the woman is pregnant.” 

This rumor came to the ears of the elder, and he told the woman's husband to let him know when she had her child. When she had given birth, the young man informed him, saying, “Through the grace of God and your prayers, father, she has given birth.” 

Then Abba Daniel went and said to the young man, “Prepare a meal, and invite your neighbors and friends.” When they had eaten, the elder took the baby in his arms and said to all present, “Who is your father?” The child responded, “That man,” pointing with his finger to the young man. The child was twenty-two days old. Everyone praised the God who is the guardian of truth for those who seek Him with their whole hearts.
