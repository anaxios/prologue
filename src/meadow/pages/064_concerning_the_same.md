## CONCERNING THE SAME

Three elders went to visit Abba Stephan the priest, and while they remained there talking about what is beneficial to the soul, he stayed silent. The elders said to him, “You are not answering us, Father. It was for the benefit of your counsel that we came to you.” 

Then he replied, “Forgive me, but I did not know what you were talking about until just now. However, I can tell you what is the matter with me; I see nothing else, either by night or by day, but our Lord Jesus Christ hanging on the cross.” 

They went their way, greatly edified.
