## A Miracle of the Most Holy Eucharist

About twenty miles from the city of AÃ©gaion in Cilicia, there were two stylites located about six miles from each other. One of them was in communion with the holy Catholic and apostolic church. The other, who had been on his column for a longer time (which was near an estate called Cassiodora), adhered to the Severan sect. 

The heretical stylite disputed with the orthodox one in various ways, contriving and desiring to win him over to his own sect. After disseminating many words, he seemed to have gotten the better of him. The orthodox stylite, as though inspired by divine influence, requested the heretic to send him a portion of his Eucharist. The heretic, delighted and thinking that he had led the other astray, sent the required portion immediately without the slightest delay. 

The orthodox received the portion that was sent to him by the heretic (the sacrament of the Severan sect) and cast it into a pot that he had brought to a boil. The substance dissolved in the boiling water. Then, he took the holy Eucharist of the orthodox church and cast it into the pot. Immediately, the pot cooled down, and the holy communion remained safe and undampened. He still keeps it, as he showed it to us when we visited him.
