I dreamt that I was working in a hospital and the man in charge was being maniacal about cleanliness. There was so much cleaning product on the floors our shoes were sticking to the floor. Everything was covered in a layer of gooey sanitizer.

I decided to tell the management what was going on so I went into the my parent's bedroom in the house where I grew up and I could hear two people in the bathroom having a secret meeting.

The man in charge came into the room and pushed me aside like he was brushing off a fly. I tried to push him back but it was like trying to move a train car â€” he didn't move an inch. He put his ear up to the bathroom door to hear what was being said inside. I tried opening the door but I couldn't move him out of the way.
