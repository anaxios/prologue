<h2>The Vision and a Saying of Abba George the Recluse</h2>
<p>Scythopolis was the second city of Palestine. There I met Abba Anastasios, who told us about Abba George the recluse.</p>
<p>One night, I got up to beat the wooden signal (for I was the precentor), and I heard an elder weeping. I went and entreated him, saying, &quot;Abba, what is the matter, sir, that you weep so?&quot; He answered me not a word. So I asked him again, &quot;Tell me the cause of your grief.&quot; Sighing from the depths of his heart, he said to me, &quot;How should I not weep, seeing that our Lord is not willing to be placated on our account? I thought I stood before one who sat on a high throne, my child.&quot;</p>
<p>Around him were several tens of thousands who besought and entreated him concerning a certain matter, but he would not be persuaded. Then a woman clothed in purple raiment came and fell down before him, saying, &quot;Please, for my sake, grant this request,&quot; but he remained equally unmoved. &quot;That is why I weep and groan, for I am afraid of what is going to happen to me.&quot; He said this to me at first light on Thursday.</p>
<p>The next day, Friday, about the ninth hour, there was a severe earthquake that overthrew the cities of the Phoenician coast. Abba Anastasios spoke to us again and told us this about the same elder: Some time later, as he stood at the window of his cell, he began to weep and said to me, &quot;Woe are we, brother, for we have no compunction, but live heedlessly. I fear we are at the gates of perdition and that the wrath of God has overtaken us.&quot; The next day, fire appeared in the sky.</p>
