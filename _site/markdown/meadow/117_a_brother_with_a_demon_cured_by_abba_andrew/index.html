<h2>A Brother with a Demon, Cured by Abba Andrew</h2>
<p>A brother possessed by a demon went to Abba Symeon the Stylite on the Wonderful Mountain to have a prayer offered for him to be rid of the demon. Abba Symeon asked him, &quot;Where do you live?&quot; The brother replied, &quot;At Raithou.&quot;</p>
<p>The elder then said, &quot;I am surprised at the toil you have endured and the journey you have undertaken to come to me, a mere sinful man, when you have such great fathers in your own lavra. Go, prostrate yourself before Abba Andrew, asking him to pray for you, and he will heal you at once.&quot;</p>
<p>The brother returned to Raithou and prostrated himself before Abba Andrew, as Abba Symeon had instructed him, saying, &quot;Pray for me, Abba.&quot; Abba Andrew replied, &quot;Abba Symeon has obtained the gift of this healing.&quot; He offered a prayer, and the brother was immediately cleansed. He gave thanks to God.</p>
