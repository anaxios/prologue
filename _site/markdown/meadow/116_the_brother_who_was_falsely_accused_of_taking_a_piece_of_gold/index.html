<h2>THE BROTHER WHO WAS FALSELY ACCUSED OF TAKING A PIECE OF GOLD</h2>
<p>Abba Andrew of Messenia told us: When I was a young man, my abba and I withdrew from Raithou and came to Palestine, where we stayed with an elder. The elder who was our host possessed one piece of gold, but he forgot where he had put it and began to suspect that I, a young man, had stolen it. The elder said to the fathers of the place, &quot;Brother Andrew took the piece of gold.&quot;</p>
<p>My abba heard this. He called me and said, &quot;Tell me, Brother Andrew, have you taken the elder’s piece of gold?&quot; I replied, &quot;Spare me, abba; I took nothing.&quot; However, I had a cloak, so I sold it for one piece of gold. I took the coin, went to the elder, and prostrated myself before him, saying, &quot;Abba, forgive me, sir. Satan led me astray and I took your piece of gold.&quot;</p>
<p>There was a worldling there, and the elder said, &quot;Go away, child; I have lost nothing.&quot; Again, I prostrated myself before him and said, &quot;For the Lord’s sake, take the piece of gold (here, this is it) and pray for me; because Satan deceived me into stealing and causing you trouble.&quot; The elder replied, &quot;Child, I lost nothing at all.&quot;</p>
<p>Because he could not convince me, the worldling said to me, &quot;Of a truth, brother, when I came yesterday, I found the elder in tears, prostrating himself in great affliction. When I saw him in such tribulation, I asked, 'Of your charity, tell me what is the matter with you?' He said to me, 'I wrongly accused the brother of taking my piece of gold, and look! I have found it where I put it.'&quot;</p>
<p>Then the elder was encouraged by the fact that, although I had not taken the piece of gold, I still brought it back to him, saying, &quot;Take your piece of gold, for it was I who took it.&quot;</p>
