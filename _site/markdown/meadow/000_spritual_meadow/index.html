<h2>TO HIS BELOVED IN CHRIST, SOPHRONIOS THE SOPHIST</h2>
<p>In my opinion, the meadows in spring present a particularly delightful prospect. They display to the beholder a rich diversity of flowers that arrests one with its charm, bringing delight to the eyes and perfume to the nostrils. One part of this meadow blushes with roses; in another place, lilies predominate, drawing attention away from the roses. In yet another part, the color of violets blazes out, resembling imperial purple. In short, the diversity and variety of innumerable flowers afford delights to both nostrils and eyes on every side.</p>
<p>Think of this present work in the same way, Sophronios, my sacred and faithful child. In it, you will discover the virtues of holy men who have distinguished themselves in our own timesâ€”men, as the Psalmist says, planted by the waterside (Psalm 1:3). They were all equally beloved of God (by the grace of Christ), yet there was a diversity in the virtues from which the beauty and charm of each derived. From among these, I have plucked the finest flowers of the unmown meadow and worked them into a crown that I now offer to you, most faithful child; and through you, to the world at large.</p>
<p>I have called this work &quot;Meadow&quot; on account of the delight, fragrance, and benefit it will afford those who come across it. For the virtuous life and habitual piety consist not merely of studying divinity; they do not solely involve thinking on an elevated plain about things as they are here and now. It must also include the written description of the way of life of others. Thus, I have striven to complete this composition to inform your love, oh child. As I have assembled a copious and accurate collection, I have emulated the most wise bee, gathering up the spiritually beneficial deeds of the fathers.</p>
<p>Now I will begin to tell you those things.</p>
