<h2>SAYINGS OF ABBA ALEXANDER THE ELDER</h2>
<p>Abba Alexander, the elder of Abba Vincent, said to the brethren: &quot;Our fathers sought out the wilderness and affliction; we seek for cities and comfort.&quot; Again, he remarked: &quot;In the days of our fathers, the virtues of poverty and humility flourished; these days, avarice and pride are in fashion.&quot; Furthermore, he observed: &quot;Our fathers never used to wash their faces; but we indulge ourselves at the public baths.&quot; He lamented: &quot;Alas, children, we have eliminated the angelic way of life.&quot;</p>
<p>Abba Vincent, his disciple, responded: &quot;We are indeed sickly, father.&quot; The elder rejoined: &quot;What do you mean, Vincent, by 'We are sickly?' Believe me, child: we are fit in body as Olympic athletes, but we are sick indeed in the soul.&quot; He added: &quot;We are able to eat and drink a great deal and to wear fine clothing; but we are incapable of mastering our passions or our pride.&quot; Lastly, the elder said: &quot;Oh, Alexander, Alexander! How you are going to be put to shame when others receive the crown!&quot;</p>
