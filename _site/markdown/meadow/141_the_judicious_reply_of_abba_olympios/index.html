<h2>THE JUDICIOUS REPLY OF ABBA OLYMPIOS</h2>
<p>A brother visited Abba Olympios at the Lavra of Abba Gerasimos near the holy Jordan and said to him: &quot;How can you stay in this place with its burning heat and so many insects?&quot; The elder answered him: &quot;I put up with the insects to escape from the worm that sleeps not. Likewise, I endure the burning heat for fear of the eternal fire. The one is temporary, but of the other, there is no end.&quot;</p>
