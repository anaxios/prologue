<h2>THE LOVE OF ABBA SISINIOS FOR A SARACEN WOMAN</h2>
<p>Abba John, priest of the Monastery of the Eunuchs, told us that he had heard Abba Sisinios the anchorite say:</p>
<p>One day, I was in my cave near the holy Jordan, and as I was singing the third hour, a Saracen woman came that way and entered my cave. She sat herself down before me and took off her clothes. I was not distracted; I quietly completed the appointed office in the fear of God. When I had finished, I said to her (in Hebrew), &quot;Sit up and let me talk to youâ€”and I will do whatever you wish.&quot; She sat up, and I then asked her, &quot;Are you Christian or pagan?&quot; She said she was Christian.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you not know that those who play the harlot go away into perdition?&quot; I asked, and she said she did. &quot;Then why do you play the harlot?&quot; I inquired. &quot;Because I am hungry,&quot; she replied. I then said to her, &quot;Stop playing the harlot and come here each day,&quot; and I began giving her some of the food that God provided for me to eat until I left those parts.</p>
