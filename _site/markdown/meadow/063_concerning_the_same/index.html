<h2>CONCERNING THE SAME</h2>
<p>They say that the same elder was once sitting in his cell when the devil appeared to him in visible form and said, &quot;Get away from here, elder, for it is no good for you.&quot; The elder replied to the demon, &quot;To convince me that you want me to go away, make what I am sitting on start walking around.&quot; He was seated on a wicker-work chair.</p>
<p>When the demon heard this, he immediately caused not only the seat but also the whole cell to move around. Upon perceiving the craftiness of the demon, the elder said, &quot;Now, since you are so fierce and terrible, I will most certainly not go away.&quot; He then offered a prayer, and the hostile demon disappeared.</p>
