<h2>Taken from discord</h2>
<p>I was baptized RC as a kid but never confirmed and never saw the inside of a church after.
My family went to a Methodist church for maybe a year or two before I was in high school.
I considered myself atheist in high school, but all my friends were protestant.
My grandmother died shortly after high school, which was the first big death in my life, and I started seeking understanding of ultimate things.
I went to a Nazarene Church maybe 3-4 years.</p>
<p>A non-denom church had a big weekly college age thing I frequented had a demonstration Seder dinner, which made me start searching for something more than contemporary worship.
I was pretty much fed up with Evangelicalism at that point.
I started looking at Messianic Judaism but that didn't last long after I found a recording on YouTube of Byzantine chant.</p>
<p>I was rebaptized in an OCA church maybe 6 months later.
It was not the norm for the diocese but the bishop allowed it.
I was very influenced by old-calendarism (It was still kind of a thing then in 2009) and I was very influenced by St. Anthony's Monastery in AZ.
It was on a trip there where I made the decision to become Orthodox.</p>
<p>Years later, I visited all the Orthodox monasteries on the west coast and then spent a semester at Jordanville Seminary.
Which is where I heard about St. Sabba's monastery in Michigan.
I when there and became a novice after a couple months.
I then left and then came back after a few years, was made a novice again immediately and then 5 months later a Riassophore and priest.
Quite to my own shock and surprise as well as everyone else's.</p>
<p>I had no desire to be a priest.
I gave up on any notion of that years before.
I wanted to be a good monk and be obedient so I said yes.
The abbot had lied to Met Hilarion that I was a monk for years to get him to agree to ordain me.
The abbot made a big thing about it and arranged Met. Jonah to have it happen while the Icon of St. Anne from St. Tikhon's was there.</p>
<p>It got weird one evening when I expressed my doubt and reluctance to one of the monks at the monatery.
The abbot was in the other room and overheard.
He was very mad and told me I would go through with it and he went out on a limb for me and not to embarrass him after him doing this all for me.</p>
<p>I didn't want this. HE DID.</p>
<p>This was the first he really showed himself to be a manipulative person.
I got to see some of it the first time I was there, but I didn't think much of it because it was never directed at me.
In the 20 or so years he couldn't keep any novice longer than a few months to a year.</p>
<p>The other monk that was there at the time was a troubled ex-meth addict and homeless person with a very troubled past who was made a monk at another monastery but kept getting himself into trouble.
The abbot started treating him very badly and mocking him for struggling.
I started noticing that the abbot would be upset and while recounting arguments he and the monk would have the abbot would make it sound like the monk was being nasty and rude to the abbot, which didn't happen.
The abbot was twisting what the monk was saying and doing to make him out to be a bad person.
After a physical altercation and many arguments he had the monk kicked out.
We found alcohol in the monks room.
It was a very sad situation.
I still feel awful for the poor monk.
He was driven to despair by the abbot.</p>
<p>The abbot then started doing the same thing to me.
He would be upset at how I treated him and twist my words to make it sound like he was being mistreated by me.
At first I would apologize but I got fed up real quick.</p>
<p>It all came to a head when the abbot came to trapeza and said that the abbot of St. Dionysios monastery wasn't going to visit for a long time because the night before, on the phone, he told off the abbot of St. Dionysios, that he was a lazy slob who sat and ate potato chips all day and watched tv and some other things.</p>
<p>I became friends with the other abbot, he came to my ordination.
I was not doing well at this point and was very upset that I might lose the only monastic friend I had.
So, I made the mistake of texting him and apologizing on behalf of the abbot.</p>
<p>The other abbot was understandably very mad and called my abbot.
Who told me to either apologize for what I had done or get out.
I left and ended up at Glorious Ascension monastery in Georgia to be alone with an old nun.</p>
<p>The first night I did vespers at Ascension I used greek to give the blessing and the nun slammed her fist on the kliros and did the rest of vespers through her gritted teeth. When she came up to get my blessing after the service she barked, &quot;we don't do langugages here&quot;.</p>
<h2>Ladyminster</h2>
<p>While I was at Ascension I was looking for a brotherhood and called Theodore.
I thought I got the wrong number and dialed a hair dresser or something by the way he flamboyantly said &quot;heeeEEEEeeellooOOOooo&quot;.
I was so taken aback I just said, &quot;what?&quot;
I was immediately unwilling to go.
A few months went by and I'd already tried a few other brotherhoods, (Met Jonah's, and St. Tikhon's) and was depressed and pretty much locked myself in my room.</p>
<p>The abbot from St. Dionysios' is also the abbot of Ascension made a surprise visit and told me I needed to go to Ladyminster.
I begged him to not go because the abbot was weird.
He forced me and I tried to make the best of it.</p>
<p>The whole place is a joke.
They didn't do the Benedict Rule, they did the BCP with a bunch of bizarre changes the abbot made to it, which he also changes every few months.
There's nothing benedictine about the place other than the habit.</p>
<p>He and the other monk there despised each other, which made for some weird dynamics.</p>
<p>Theodore kept embracing me by putting his body against my side from his chest to his knee and whispering things in my ears.
He would come up and press himself onto me and whisper, &quot;Don't for get to wash the dishes.&quot;
I was completely disgusted by this.
It's not appropriate but certainly not appropriate for monastics.</p>
<p>I stopped going to confession with him after he told me what another priest had confessed.
This priest was visiting soon and I would know exactly who it was.
This is breaking the seal of confession.</p>
<p>The last straw for me was when I was alone with the abbot he pressed his crotch to my upper arm while I was fixing his computer.
He was clothed but I could feel his junk under his cassock.
I didn't know what to do so I just tried to leaned over to get away from him.</p>
<p>I told his bishop but he treated me like I was a troublemaker.
I stopped going to services and was kicked out when I tried to tell a novice to be careful of the abbot's actions.</p>
<p>I just don't want young guys to get hurt by Theodore.
My encounter wasn't &quot;serious&quot; like he drugged me or something and I'm a grown adult of almost 40 but I'm still affected a lot by it.
I can't imagine the suffering he could cause a young impressionable kid.</p>
<p>He's really the reason I can't bare the thought of telling anyone a confession ever again.</p>
<p>Before Ladyminster, he was a monk at a monastery where the abbot was arrested for cp and the monastery fell apart.
So, he went to Ladyminster (which they are only caretakers of) and took a layman with him who wears purple contact lenses.
Theodore complains the bishop just left them after the abbot was arrested.</p>
<p>The purple contact lens guy is the caretaker of layminster.
I don't know.
Before that he was a monk at St. John's monastery in Manton Ca. which was nicknamed Man-Town by the other monasteries.</p>
<h2>Jordanville</h2>
<p>One monk gave me dirty looks and would steal my seat in church.
He wouldn't leave me be.
He stood with his face an inch from mine and made the sign of the cross over and over again.
If he wasn't elderly I would have knocked his teeth out.
He was making me think the evil eye ðŸ§¿ is real.
He would defy the bishop and go pretent to be a holy elder to the poor unsuspecting guests.
I wanted to video him to show the abbot, but I didn't want to get into more trouble.
I remember once I heard him scolding a young lady for having earnings.
He said, &quot;I don't want to see you with those again.&quot;, like he had any right to say a word to her.
Plus, earrings are completely normal.
He just liked to exercise power over people, I guess.</p>
<p>Another monk told me how he was an elementary teacher and one day he felt one of his students had a bad thought about him and he immediately got a horrible tooth pain.
He has a lot of tolerance for pain, he said, but this was more pain than he could handle.
He went into get it taken care of and before the procedure he felt that the little girl had forgiven him and the pain went away.</p>
<p>Another older monk had the sniffles and was very upset because when he was young he never got sick because the monks back then were holy but now the monks don't do their prayer and it's making him sick.</p>
<p>One of the head monks worked for Disney or something and he would imitate Disney character voices all day long, repeating catchphrases.
He's the one who would tell all the seminarians to use rogaine on their faces to have nice beards.
I feel a bit bad for him because he came into Orthodoxy through a schismatic Old Calendarist group who made him an archimandrite in 6 months or something.
It was like 30 years ago, but still, that's a horrible thing to do to someone.</p>
<p>I almost forgot the lay cook who smoked pot in the monastery all the time.
The place would reek.
The abbot was not happy, but nothing ever happened to the guy.
My only guess is that he had a lot of money so they put up with it.</p>
<p>One of the monks kept trying to get me to try his THC oil because I have arthritis from a broken back.</p>
