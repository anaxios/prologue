## ANOTHER MIRACLE: OF THE BAPTISTRY OF THE VILLAGE OF CEDREBAT

In the village of Cedrebat, in the vicinity of the city of Oenoanda, there is a font that consists of one single piece of stone. At the paschal feast of the resurrection, it suddenly fills up on its own accord and retains the water until Pentecost. Then, suddenly, after Pentecost, the water disappears. Both of these wonders are in the Province of Lycia. If anybody does not believe this, it is no burdensome journey to Lycia, where they can inform themselves of the truth.
