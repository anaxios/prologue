## The Exhortation of an Elder Who Lived at Sceté to a Monk, Not to Enter Taverns

There was a monk living at Scété who went up to Alexandria to sell his handiwork. He saw a younger monk go into a tavern, which troubled the elder. He waited outside, intending to meet the monk when he came out, and indeed, this is what happened.

When the younger monk came out, the elder took him by the hand and led him aside, saying to him, “Brother, do you not realize that you are wearing the holy habit? Do you not know that you are a young man? Are you not aware that the snares of the devil are many? Do you not know that monks who live in cities are wounded by means of their eyes, their hearing, and their clothing? You went into the tavern of your own free will; you hear things you do not want to hear and see things you would rather not see, dishonorably mingling with both men and women. Please do not do it, but flee to the wilderness where you can find the salvation you desire.”

The young man answered him, “Away with you, good elder. God requires nothing but a pure heart.” 

Then the elder raised his hands to heaven and said, “Glory to You, O God, that I have spent fifty years at Scété and have not acquired a pure heart, yet this man, who frequents taverns, has attained pureness of heart.” He turned to the brother and said, “May God save you and not disappoint me in my hope.” (Psalm 118:116)
