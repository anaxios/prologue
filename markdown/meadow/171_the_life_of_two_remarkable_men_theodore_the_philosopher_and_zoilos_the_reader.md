## THE LIFE OF TWO REMARKABLE MEN, THEODORE THE PHILOSOPHER AND ZOILOS THE READER

In Alexandria, there were two wondrously virtuous men: Abba Theodore the philosopher and Zoilos the reader. We were well acquainted with both of them—Theodore through his lectures and Zoilos because we shared the same homeland and upbringing.

Abba Theodore had no possessions whatsoever, except for a philosopher's cloak and a few books. He slept on a bench whenever he came across a church. He finally renounced the world at the Community of Salama, where he ended his days.

As for Zoilos the reader, he too was equally indifferent to possessions. He had nothing but a philosopher's cloak, a very old suit, and a few books. Calligraphy was his occupation. When he died in the Lord, he was buried at Lithazomenos, in the monastery of Abba Palladios.

Some fathers went to Master Cosmas the lawyer and asked him about Abba Theodore the philosopher and Zoilos the reader: which of the two had progressed farther in the practice of asceticism? He replied, “They both had the same kind of clothing, the same kind of bed, and the same kind of food. They both rejected anything that was in excess of basic necessities. They were equal in humility, poverty, and self-discipline. 

But Abba Theodore, who went barefoot and suffered greatly with his eyes, had learned both the Old and the New Testaments by heart. He also had the consolation of the company of the brethren and contact with friends— a not inconsiderable distraction when he was active and when he was teaching. 

In the case of Zoilos the reader, not only was his isolation from the world (xeniteia) praiseworthy, but so was his solitude (erémia), his immense toil, and the way he kept his tongue on a leash. He had no friends, nothing to call his own, and no one to talk to. He engaged in no worldly activity, allowed himself no relief, nor would he accept the smallest service from anybody. He did his own cooking and washing, and he allowed himself no pleasure from reading. He was ready to be of service to others; neither cold nor heat nor bodily sickness mattered to him. 

He shunned laughter, sadness, inactivity, and relaxation. For all the exiguity of his clothing, he was constantly devoured by lice. Yet this man, in comparison with the first one, had no small consolation from his freedom of movement, for he was entirely free to go wherever he wished, by night or by day. However, even this freedom was of no avail, for so heavy was his toil that he never made use of it.

Thus, he appeared to studiously avoid over-much contact with the world. Each one of them shall receive his own reward, consonant with his toil and the progress he made, his spiritual and mental purity, his fear of God, his charity, his worship, his compunction (katanu.xis), his constancy in psalm-singing and prayer, his persistent faith—and the good pleasure of God, which is hidden and concealed from people.
