## ABBA PALLADIOS’ STORY OF AN OLD MAN WHO COMMITTED MURDER AND FALSELY ACCUSED A YOUTH OF THE SAME CRIME

Abba Palladios told us that an old man living in the world was arrested for murder. When he was tortured by the magistrate of Alexandria, he claimed that somebody else had been involved in the murder as his accomplice—a young fellow about twenty years old. Both were severely tortured. The old man said, “You were with me when I committed the murder.” The youth denied having anything to do with the affair and asserted that he had not been with the old man. 

After enduring severe torture, both were condemned to be hanged. They were taken to the fifth mile-post from the city, where it was customary to punish such criminals. About one stade away, there was a ruined temple of Kronos. Upon arriving at the place, the populace and the soldiers wanted to hang the youth on the scaffold first. He made a profound act of obeisance before the soldiers and said, “For the sake of the Lord, of your charity, hang me towards the east so that I may look in that direction when I am hanging there alone.” 

The soldiers asked him, “Why so?” He replied, “In truth, sirs, it is only seven months since your unworthy servant received baptism and became a Christian.” When they heard this, the soldiers wept for the youth. The old man then called out in great anger, “By Serapis, hang me so I look towards Kronos!” When the soldiers heard the blasphemy of the old man, they decided to leave the youth aside and hang the old man instead. 

As they were carrying this out, a mounted messenger arrived from the prefect and instructed the soldiers, “Do not execute the youth; bring him back.” This news brought joy to all the soldiers present. They took the youth and brought him back into the praetorium, where the prefect released him. Having been rescued when he had despaired of salvation, the young man went on to become a monk. 

We have written this for the benefit of many, including ourselves, so that we might be aware that the Lord knows how to deliver the godly from temptation.
