## THE LIFE OF ELIAS, ARCHBISHOP OF JERUSALEM AND CONCERNING FLAVIAN, PATRIARCH OF ANTIOCH

Abba Polychronios said of Abba Elias, Archbishop of Jerusalem, that when he was a monk, he never drank wine, and after he became patriarch, he continued to observe the same rule. It is said of Archbishop Elias of Jerusalem and Flavian, the Archbishop of Antioch, that Emperor Anastasios exiled them both on account of the holy synod of the fathers at Chalcedon: Elias to Eilat and Flavian to Petra.

One day, the two patriarchs revealed to each other that Anastasios had died that very day. "Let us go, too, to be judged with him," they said, and two days later, they went to the Lord.
