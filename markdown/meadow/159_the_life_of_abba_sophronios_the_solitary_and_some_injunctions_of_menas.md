## THE LIFE OF ABBA SOPHRONIOS THE SOLITARY AND SOME INJUNCTIONS OF MENAS

Abba Menas, the higoumen of the monastery of Abba Severian, spoke about Abba Sophronios the grazer: "He grazed around the Dead Sea. For seventy years, he lived naked, eating wild plants and nothing else."

Abba Menas also mentioned that he had heard Abba Sophronios say, "I prayed to the Lord that the demons would not come near my cave. I saw them coming to within three stades of the cave, but they were unable to come any nearer."

He advised the brothers in the community, saying, "My little children, let us avoid communications with those of the world, for these can be hurtful, especially to younger monks." He further stated, "Persons of every age, both young and old, need to repent in order to enjoy eternal life in the future with praise and great glory. Young men need to repent because, in the full flood of carnal desire, they have bent their necks beneath the yoke; old men need to repent so that they might change their propensity for evil, which has been reinforced by long habitude."
