## THE LIFE OF THE BLESSED GENNADIOS, PATRIARCH OF CONSTANTINOPLE, AND OF HIS READER, CHARISIOS

We visited the Community of Salama, nine miles outside of Alexandria, where we found two elders who claimed to be priests of the Church of Constantinople. They spoke to us about Gennadios, the blessed Patriarch of Constantinople, stating that he was very gentle, pure of body, and very much in control of himself. 

They recounted that he was troubled by many complaints regarding a cleric who was leading a very dissolute life, a man named Charisios. The Patriarch sent for him and tried to correct him through exhortation, but when this failed, he proceeded to chastise and discipline him like a father and a churchman. The Patriarch soon realized that this approach was doing the cleric no good; Charisios had begun indulging in murder and dabbling in witchcraft. 

Consequently, he sent one of his agents with a message for the holy martyr Eleutherios, in whose oratory Charisios served as lector: "Saint Eleutherios, your officer is a great sinner. Either reform him, or get rid of him." The agent went to the oratory of the holy martyr Eleutherios, stood before the altar, turned towards the apse, stretched out his hand, and addressed the martyr: “Holy martyr of Christ, the Patriarch Gennadios declares to you, through me, a sinner though I be, that your officer is deeply in sin. You are either to reform him or get rid of him.”

The next day, that worker of evil deeds was found dead. All were amazed and glorified God.
