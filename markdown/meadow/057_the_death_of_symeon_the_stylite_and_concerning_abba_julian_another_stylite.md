## THE DEATH OF SYMEON THE STYLITE AND CONCERNING ABBA JULIAN, ANOTHER STYLITE

Four miles from the city of Egaion, there was a stylite named Symeon. He was struck by lightning and died. Abba Julian the stylite, whose pillar was on the Gulf of Alexandretta, told his disciples to burn incense, not at the accustomed time. 

The disciples said to him, "Tell us why, father." He replied, "Because brother Symeon of Egaion has been struck by lightning and is dead. Behold, his soul is departing with great gladness." They were twenty-four miles apart from each other.
