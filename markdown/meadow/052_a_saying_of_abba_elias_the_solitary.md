## A Saying of Abba Elias the Solitary

A brother visited Abba Elias the solitary at the community of the cave of Abba Sabas and said to him, "Abba, give me a saying!" The elder responded, "In the days of our fathers, three virtues were cherished: poverty, humility, and continence. Now monks are dominated by avarice, gluttony, and audacity. Hold on to which of these you will."
