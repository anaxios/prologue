## THE LIFE OF AN ELDER, A MONK LIVING NEAR THE CITY OF ANTINOE AND CONCERNING HIS PRAYER FOR A DEAD BROTHER

When we came to the Thebaid, one of the elders told us that there was an elder of great repute living outside the city of Antinoé, one who had kept his cell for about seventy years. He had ten disciples, but one of them was very careless regarding his own soul. The elder often besought and entreated him, saying, "Brother, pay attention to your own soul, for death awaits you, and the road to punishment is near."

The brother always disregarded the elder, refusing to accept what he said. Eventually, death carried the brother off, and the elder was deeply troubled, knowing that he had left this world sadly lacking in faith and devotion. The elder fell to his prayers and said, "Lord Jesus Christ, our true God, reveal to me the state of the brother’s soul."

He went into a trance and saw a river of fire with a multitude of people in the fire itself. Right in the middle was the brother, submerged up to his neck. The elder called out to him, "Was it not because of this retribution that I urged you to look after your own soul, my child?"

The brother answered, "I thank God, father, that there is relief for my head. Thanks to your prayers, I am standing on the head of a bishop."
