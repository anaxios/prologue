## AN ASS IN THE SERVICE OF THE MONASTERY CALLED MARDES

There is a mountain by the Dead Sea called Mardes, and it is very high. There are anchorites living on that mountain. They have a garden about six miles away from where they live, near the edge of the sea, almost on its banks. One of the anchorites is stationed there to tend the garden.

At whatever hour the anchorites wish to send for vegetables, they put a pack-saddle on the ass and say to it, "Go to the one who tends the garden and bring us some vegetables." The ass goes off alone to find the gardener. When it stands before the door, it knocks with its head. The gardener loads it up with vegetables and sends it away.

You can see the ass returning alone each time, but it only serves those elders; it supplies the needs of nobody else.
