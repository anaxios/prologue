## THE LIFE OF ABBA GREGORY THE ANCHORITE AND OF THALILAIOS, HIS DISCIPLE

Some of the fathers told us about Abba George (Gregory) the anchorite, who for thirty-five years traveled around naked in the wilderness. They said that when he was in the mountains where the monastery of Abba Theodosios (at Skopelos) is located, he had a disciple who died. As the elder had no tools with which to dig a grave to bury the brother’s body, he went down from the mountain to the sea, where he found a ship riding at anchor. 

He asked the shipmaster and the crew to come up into the mountain with him to bury the brother. They agreed willingly and, taking the necessary tools, went up with him. They dug a grave and buried the brother’s body. One of the sailors, whose name was Thalilaios, was very impressed with the virtue of the elder and asked him if he could stay with him. The elder told him that he would not be able to support the rigor of the ascetic life. The younger man replied that he was sure he could endure it. 

So, he remained with the elder and was there for a whole year, making a great effort in ascetic endeavor. When the year was up, brother Thalilaios prostrated himself before the elder and said, "Pray for me, father, for, thanks to your prayers, God has relieved me of suffering, and I am no longer afflicted by discomfort, nor does this intemperate weather trouble me. I neither faint with the heat nor shiver with the cold; I am in great comfort." 

The elder blessed him, and brother Thalilaios remained with him for two and a half years. Then he perceived that his end was near. He begged the elder, "Take me to Jerusalem so I can venerate the Holy Cross and the Holy Sepulchre of Christ our God; for these are the days in which the Lord will take me to Himself." The elder therefore took him, and they went to the Holy City. 

They worshipped at the holy and venerable places and then went down to the holy Jordan, where they were baptized. Three days later, brother Thalilaios died. The elder buried him in the Copratha lavra. Some time later, Abba George the anchorite himself departed this life, and the fathers of the same lavra at Copratha buried him in their own church.
