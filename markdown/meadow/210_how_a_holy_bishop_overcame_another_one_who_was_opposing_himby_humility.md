## How a Holy Bishop Overcame Another One Who Was Opposing Him—by Humility

One of the fathers said that there were two neighboring bishops who had an altercation with each other. One was rich and the other more lowly. The rich one sought to do the other a mischief. The lowly bishop heard of this and, knowing what he was going to do, said to his clergy, "We shall triumph by the grace of Christ." They replied, "My lord, who could possibly prevail against that one?" He said to them, "Wait, and you shall see."

He bided his time, and when his fellow bishop was celebrating a feast in honor of some holy martyrs, he gathered his clergy and said to them, "Follow me, and we shall triumph." They murmured to themselves, "What can he be going to do?" 

The lowly bishop approached the other bishop, and as he passed by in the procession, the visiting bishop fell at his feet, together with the clergy, saying, "Forgive us; we are your lordship’s humble servants." The other was amazed at what he had done, and a stab of remorse went through his soul. God gave him a change of heart, and he now grasped his colleague’s feet, saying, "It is you who are my lord and father." From that time on, there was a strong bond of love between them.

The lowly bishop then said to his clergy, "Did I not tell you that we should triumph by the grace of God? When there is any ill feeling between you, do likewise—and triumph." The elder also stated that a humble man has more glory than the emperor himself; for the emperor is only praised in his presence, whereas a humble man is praised and said to be blessed both in and out of his presence.
