<h2 id="saint-gregory-the-enlightener-bishop-of-armenia">SAINT GREGORY THE ENLIGHTENER, BISHOP OF ARMENIA</h2>
<p>Gregory was born of a prominent family which was related to the royal houses of Persia (King Arteban) and Armenia (King Khosrov). When these two houses made war against each other, Gregory withdrew to Caesarea in Cappadocia. It was there that he first learned of the Christian Faith, was baptized and married. He had two sons of this marriage, Bardanes and Aristakes, and dedicated them both to the service of the Church. After the death of his wife, Gregory returned to Armenia and placed himself in the service of King Tiridates. He faithfully served him, and Tiridates loved Gregory. But when the king learned that Gregory was a Christian, he became greatly enraged and pressured him to deny Christ and worship idols. Not succeeding in this, Tiridates subjected Gregory to many harsh tortures, then threw him into a deep pit full of poisonous reptiles to kill him. However, the All-seeing God preserved St. Gregory&#8217;s life in that pit for fourteen full years. After that, Tiridates set out to persecute all Christians in his kingdom, and attacked a convent where there were thirty-seven nuns, including the abbess, Gaiana. When he had killed all of them by terrible tortures, Tiridates went insane and was like a wild boar. His sister had a dream in which a man, dazzlingly bright, told her that Tiridates would only become well when Gregory was removed from the pit. Taken from the pit, Gregory healed and baptized Tiridates. Then, at the wish of Tiridates, Gregory became Bishop of Armenia. Through God&#8217;s providence, Tiridates also helped him in enlightening all of Armenia and its surrounding regions with the Christian Faith. St. Gregory ended his earthly life of great labor in old age, in about the year 335 A.D. Meanwhile, his son Aristakes had been consecrated a bishop, and he continued the work of his father, both physically and spiritually. Aristakes was one of the 318 Holy Fathers at the First Ecumenical Council.</p>
<h2 id="the-holy-martyrs-gaiana-rhipsimia-and-thirty-five-other-nuns">THE HOLY MARTYRS GAIANA, RHIPSIMIA, AND THIRTY-FIVE OTHER NUNS</h2>
<p>They were all slain by King Tiridates because of their faith in Christ. Rhipsimia was of unusual beauty, which tempted Emperor Diocletian to take her for his wife. This was the cause of their martyrdom. Rhipsimia refused to go with the emperor, as she had betrothed herself to Christ, her Bridegroom. Then Tiridates too was tempted and wanted to claim her for himself, for he was intoxicated by her beauty. St. Rhipsimia resisted the pagan king with all her strength, &#8220;And he who defeated the Princes of the Goths and destroyed the Persians was unable to overcome one virgin of Christ.&#8221; The enraged king gave her over to cruel tortures&#8211;her tongue was cut out, her stomach cut open, and her entrails pulled out&#8211;and Rhipsimia gave up her soul to God. After this, the other nuns were seized and beheaded. The famous Monastery of Echmiadzin was built over the relics of these holy martyrs. Situated near Yerevan, it was the main spiritual center of Armenia for many centuries.</p>
<h2 id="saint-michael-first-metropolitan-of-kiev">SAINT MICHAEL, FIRST METROPOLITAN OF KIEV</h2>
<p>St. Michael was sent to Russia by the Patriarch of Constantinople at the request of the great Prince Vladimir, to baptize the pagan people and establish and organize the Church. St. Michael baptized the people in Kiev, Novgorod, Rostov and many other towns and villages. He organized the Church, appointed bishops and priests, laid the foundation for the Monastery of St. Michael in Kiev, and sent missionaries among the Bulgarians and Tartars, winning many of them for Christ. This saint accomplished all this, and much more of great benefit, in only four years. He went to his reward peacefully, in the year 992 A.D. His relics repose in the Monastery of the Kiev Caves.</p>
<h2 id="hymn-of-praise">HYMN OF PRAISE</h2>
<h3 id="saint-gregory-the-enlightener">SAINT GREGORY THE ENLIGHTENER</h3>
<p>Gregory was a great light<br/>
To his people and his nation.<br/>
He spurned glory and riches<br/>
For the poverty of Christ the Crucified,<br/>
Preferring eternal riches in heaven.<br/>
He raised his mind to heaven and thoughts of God,<br/>
And endured much physical torture,<br/>
As if it all were painless.<br/>
He was strong with the power of God&#8217;s grace,<br/>
And nourished by God&#8217;s heavenly food,<br/>
And armored against evil by God&#8217;s providence.<br/>
He was lowered into the pit from his glory,<br/>
And from the pit he was elevated to the heights&#8211;<br/>
The heights of eternal glory.<br/>
Gregory, great and holy,<br/>
Enlightened Armenia with Jesus.<br/>
Even the wild boar, Tiridates,<br/>
Was baptized under the Cross and became a lamb.<br/>
With great glory, the land of Armenia glorifies<br/>
Its miracle-worker, St. Gregory.</p>
<h2 id="reflection">REFLECTION</h2>
<p>Marvelous changes occur daily in the destiny of men&#8211;in the present, as in times past. Those humiliated for the sake of God&#8217;s righteousness are raised to great heights, and the blasphemers of the Faith are converted to servants of the Faith. King Tiridates threw St. Gregory into a deep pit. The saint spent fourteen years in that pit, forgotten by the entire world, but not by God. Who among men could have thought that the greatest light of the Armenian people was to be found in the darkness of a pit? And who would have ever thought that the powerful and tyrannical King Tiridates would one day save the life of that same Gregory, whom he had condemned to death, and would help him more than the rest of the whole world could help him? After fourteen years, God revealed Gregory as still alive. Gregory then miraculously healed the insane king. King Tiridates, the unrestrained persecutor of Christ, was baptized and became the greatest zealot for the Christian Faith! It could be said that, with God&#8217;s help, Gregory and Tiridates were both drawn out of the pit of darkness&#8211;Gregory a physical one, and Tiridates a spiritual one. Oh, the infinite wisdom of God in governing the destinies of men! The formerly wild and passionate Tiridates was softened and ennobled so much by repentance and the Christian Faith, that he came to resemble St. Gregory more than his old, unrepentant self.</p>
<h2 id="contemplation">CONTEMPLATION</h2>
<p>Contemplate the righteousness of King Jotham and God&#8217;s reward for him (II Chronicles 27):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How Jotham did that which is right in the sight of the Lord, and cared for the Temple of the Lord;</p></li>
<li><p>How God helped him, so that he was successful in war and in peace: in war he conquered, and in peace he enriched and strengthened his people.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="homily">HOMILY</h2>
<h3 id="on-the-kingdom-not-of-this-world">ON THE KINGDOM NOT OF THIS WORLD</h3>
<p>My Kingdom is not of this world (John 18:36).</p>
<p>He who has great wealth also has little wealth. Therefore, let no one think that Christ the Lord does not have royal authority over this world, even though He told Pilate: <em>My Kingdom is not of this world</em>. He who possesses the eternal also rules over the temporal. Here, the Lord speaks of His Eternal Kingdom, independent of time, decay, injustice, illusion and death. It is as if someone were to say: &#8220;My wealth is not in paper but rather in gold.&#8221; If he has gold, can he not afford paper? Is not gold worth more than paper? Therefore, the Lord does not tell Pilate that He is a king, but on the contrary says that He is a higher King than all earthly kings, and that His Kingdom is greater, more powerful and more enduring than all earthly kingdoms. He is indicating His principal Kingdom, upon which all earthly kingdoms depend, in time and in space. <em>My Kingdom is not of this world</em>. This does not mean that He has no power over this world, but on the contrary confirms His awesome power over this world. All His works on earth manifest His unparalleled, lordly power over the world. Tell me, in what other king&#8217;s presence is the wind quieted and the sea calmed? And have you forgotten His words in Gethsemane? <em>Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and He shall presently give Me more than twelve legions of angels?</em> (Matthew 26:53). And just one angel has greater power than all the universe! The Lord of the soul is also the Lord of the body. The Lord of eternity is also the Lord of time. The Lord of the greatest good is also the Lord of the lesser good. Brethren, nothing can escape the power of the Almighty Jesus Christ our Lord, Who by His own will suffered for us, and by His own power rose from the grave.</p>
<p>O Lord Jesus Christ, our Almighty Savior, help us to seek Thy Heavenly Kingdom, and to be eternally with Thee where there is neither sin nor death, but life and joy and peace.</p>
<h3 id="to-thee-be-glory-and-praise-forever.-amen.">To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.</h3>
